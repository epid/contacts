This is a simple test app I wrote to try looking up city, state and county (parish)
information based on zip code entry. Basically, when you are editing a contact, type
in the zip and the site will do an AJAX lookup and auto-fill the city, state and county.

Make sure that the zipcode database is populated using the .dump file in the db folder first.
